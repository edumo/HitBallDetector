# HitBallDetector

Computer vision app to detect balls hitting a Wall with one IR camera and two lights sources. 

## The problem

We need to detect ball hits in a wall with only one ir camera. The balls has different sizes and colors, can 
throw many balls at same time.

## Solutions

We will try different solutions

### OPENCV

We will track the blobs generated by balls and analyze the path generated.

### Machine Learning

- (Maybe) Test DWT with wekinator
- Test HOG descriptor generation with dlib
- (Maybe) train multiclasiffier dlib
