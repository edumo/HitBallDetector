# HitBallDetector

Computer vision app to detect balls hitting a Wall with one IR camera and two lights sources. Development of this project was supported by nexcommunity.com.

## The problem

We need to detect ball hits in a wall with only one ir camera ad two light sources. The balls has different sizes and colors, can throw many balls at same time. Two app instances will run on the same windows 10 machine.

## Architecture

The video sources will be shared throw spout 1280x720, the Spout2OpenCV project is an openframeworks.cc project using spot 2.0 and opencv compiled with vs2017.

The HitDetector project is a P5 (processing.org) project using eclipse as IDE, detects and identify blobs in a scene over time. Using the path of each blob we look for when and where the ball is hitting.

We need a HitDetector instance for each camera, also a wekinator instance running in different ports for each. Could be used only one instance, the running is not dependent.


## Solutions

We will try different solutions

### OPENCV

We will track the blobs generated by balls and analyze the path generated. Rates detecting hits are correct for the porpouse of these project. We will test some modern techniques as research target.

### Machine Learning

- Wekinator Image Classifiers
- Tests DWT with wekinator
- Tests HOG descriptor generation with dlib
- Tests DNN dlib 

### WEKINATOR CLASSIFIERS

After testing the solutions explained below using object detection, we look for reduce the problem to a classification problem using the blob tracking data.

The app will send to Wekinator a downsampled matrix with finded blobs, and wekinator will classify each matrix image with two classes Hit and Ball. this allow us to know if the blob is hitting.


### DWT

Dwt is nice to detect gestures, if only one ball is on scene this method will work smoothly with blobs positions. De shadow and the ball draws a nice pattern using Y axes of each blob. Detecting hits using the identification from opencv could be a nice solution but you need each instances of wekinator as the maximun of the blobs that could be detected. 

### HOG DLIB

Maybe for the small dataset or how we used dlib the detection is not good.

### DNN DLIB

Finally we has not used dlib. The project has to run on windows, and after getting everything compiling with many hours with vs2017 + CUDA + OPENCV, the trainning is using gpu, but gpu is not used running the demos. Using dlib is hardest on windows than linux or OSX. Tests done with linux works simplier. The dataset is shared ... 

#### Object detection

After multiclass is trainned we've tested a simplier demo without any changes in net or code

## WEKINATOR IMAGE CLASSIFIERS

Finally we are using Wekinator
